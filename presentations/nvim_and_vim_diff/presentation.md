# Intro

- Why didn't I call this "Vim vs. Neovim"


# API

- Standardized API w/ versions
- Remote Plugins
    - GUIs are a plugin

# Single Build

- For me, as a plugin user/author, having one build with one version is very helpful

# Lua

- Lua integration as first class citizen
- LuaJIT unlocks new possibilites: see Telescope
    - LuaJIT can be over 1000x faster for some cases (tight loops, etc.)
- C extensions & Luarocks
    - LibUV is an incredible library exposed with Lua


# New / Upcoming Features (available on nightly!)

- (Shared) async jobs
