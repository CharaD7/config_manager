Goals for stream:

1. Make an optimized file finder, probably with a few options
2. Make a few tests for it
3. Make a few iterations on mapping stuff
4. More window configuration options
5. Write some docs for telescope.

example of how telescope worked was around 2:48ish on stream.
- Should add the clip to the command
