Goals:

- finish thoughts on `finders`

- Get vertical window working 
    ___________
    | preview |
    | preview |
    -----------
    | resuls  |
    | results |
    -----------
    | prompt  |
    -----------

        110 x 60
        110 x 100

- Setting window percentages.
    80% width, 20% height or whatever you want.

- Better `finders` behavior
    - Perhaps `batched finders`
        This way you could use fzf inside of telescope if you wanted.


    - Support `writer` / `pipe` pattern more?

    - Support more `entry_maker` items.

- Also add / show how to add other things like "open in tab", "open in "split", etc.

Bug Fix:
- file with spaces in name
- don't use `vimgrep` with rg, it's slower.
