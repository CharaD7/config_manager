Goals for stream:

0. [x] Make a repo to hold some hints
        / callbacks 
        / etc.
 
1. [x] Implement inlay hints for rust
    This is an example of custom callbacks

2. [ ] Implement FZF integration for quickfix style things


Topics:
- completion.nvim
- diagnostics.nvim

While we're doing that, we can just answer questions or different stuff about LSP










Finders -> Gets list of results
        -> calls a function on each result

Pickers 
        -> Managers the found results

Previewers
        -> Takes a given result, and runs some code to preview it

Sorters
        -> Determines the score for a particular result



Currently, telescope.nvim expects results to always be strings.

What I'd like to have, is that we can have "objects" that can store state about themselves.

Strings are annoying, and it's annoying to parse them all the time
