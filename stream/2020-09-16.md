neovim tries to port vim patches
however:
1. neovim doesn't have same coding style
2. neovim doesn't have smae #ifdefs (as in, we have none basicallyk, because we just haveo ne build)
3. neovim has some incompatible (completely incompatible) parts of the code base
-> viml interpreter
-> terminal
-> async jobs

so that makes patching hard.

then, vim implements more patches (which is cool, cause vim is getting features)
this puts neovim further behind
...

now it's even harder to port patches.
